+# Contributing to simple-grpc-router
 
+First off, thank you for considering contributing to simple-grpc-router. It's people like you that make simple-grpc-router such a great tool.
+
+## Where do I go from here?
+
+If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make a new issue! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.
+
+## Fork & create a branch
+
+If this is something you think you can fix, then fork and create a branch with a descriptive name.
+
+```bash
+git checkout -b my-feature-branch
+```
+
+## Get the test suite running
+Make sure you're using a recent node version and run:
+    
+```bash
+npm install
+npm test
+```
+
+## Implement your fix or feature
+At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.
+
+## Make a Pull Request
+At this point, you should switch back to your master branch and make sure it's up to date with simple-grpc-router's master branch:
+```bash
+git remote add upstream git@github.com:pubg/simple-grpc-router.git
+git checkout master
+git pull upstream master
+```
+
+Then update your feature branch from your local copy of master, and push it!
 ```bash
-npm run generate-types
-```
\ No newline at end of file
+git checkout my-feature-branch
+git rebase master
+git push --set-upstream origin my-feature-branch
+```
+
+Finally, go to GitHub and make a Pull Request :D
+
+## Merging a PR (maintainers only)
+
+A PR can only be merged into master by a maintainer if:
+
+1. It is passing CI.
+2. It has been approved by at least two maintainers. If it was a maintainer who opened the PR, only one extra approval is needed.
+3. It has no requested changes.
+4. It is up to date with current master.
+
+Any maintainer is allowed to merge a PR if all of these conditions are met.
+
+## Shipping a release (maintainers only)
+
+1. Make sure all PRs are in and CI is green.
+2. Update the version in package.json (we follow semver).
+3. Update CHANGELOG.md.
+4. Commit and push.
+5. Create a git tag for the version: `git tag v1.0.0`.
+6. Push the tag to GitHub: `git push origin v1.0.0`.
+7. Create a GitHub release and include highlights for the version.
+8. Celebrate!
+
